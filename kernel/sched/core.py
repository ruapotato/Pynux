# kernel/sched/core.py
#
# Mirrors kernel/sched/core.c in Linux at minimal scale: a small
# runqueue, task_struct, and schedule() built on the context-switch
# primitive in arch/x86/kernel/sched_asm.S.
#
# **Preemption model (M16.9+):** schedule() is called ONLY from the
# timer ISR. There is no cooperative yield_cpu — every task switch
# happens through common_irq, so every paused task's stack has the
# same shape: iret frame at top, common_irq's saved-register slots
# below, then __switch_to_asm's 6 callee-saved regs and a return
# address.
#
# Freshly-created tasks don't yet have a previous IRQ stack to
# resume on, so kthread_create() pre-builds an equivalent one
# byte-by-byte and points the return-from-__switch_to_asm slot at
# kthread_bootstrap (which IS common_irq's tail).
#
# The first task is entered via enter_first_task() in
# arch/x86/kernel/sched_asm.S — it loads the new task's stack
# pointer and never returns to the boot context.

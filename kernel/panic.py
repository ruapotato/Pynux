# kernel/panic.py
#
# Mirrors the smallest meaningful slice of kernel/panic.c in Linux:
# panic(), BUG(), and WARN_ON(). All three terminate or interrupt the
# normal printk flow with a recognizable banner so an operator can spot
# them in serial logs.
#
# Pynux's lack of varargs and lack of `__FILE__`/`__LINE__` macros means
# call sites supply a single descriptive string. The convention is the
# same as Linux when reading panic.c without the macros:
#
#     panic("oom");                       -- Linux
#     panic("OOM in early_init")          -- Pynux equivalent
#
#     BUG();                              -- Linux (macro grabs file/line)
#     BUG("free of unowned page")         -- Pynux supplies it explicitly
#
#     WARN_ON(x > MAX);                   -- Linux
#     WARN_ON(x > MAX, "x exceeded MAX")  -- Pynux equivalent
#
# We deliberately don't try to fake a backtrace yet. Once we have a
# frame-walker that can read %rbp chains, BUG() will grow a `dump_stack()`
# call (and WARN_ON the same).

# mm/memblock.py
#
# Mirrors mm/memblock.c in Linux. The earliest memory allocator — runs
# before the page allocator, the slab, and kmalloc exist. Memblock owns
# a single contiguous "region of physically usable RAM" that the rest of
# the kernel carves chunks from during bring-up; once the buddy
# allocator is up the unused remainder is handed off.
#
# For M16.3 we implement only the bump-allocation subset of Linux's
# memblock API — enough to satisfy mem_init() consumers in arch/x86/mm.
# No regions list, no NUMA, no reservation tracking. The single region
# is defined by:
#
#   memblock_region_start: low water mark (== next allocation address)
#   memblock_region_end:   high water mark, allocations past this fail
#
# Choice of physical range:
#   start = 0x00200000 (2 MiB) — well above our kernel image, which
#                                lives at 0x100000..~0x108000.
#   end   = 0x0F000000 (240 MiB) — fits inside the 256 MiB QEMU runs
#                                  with. Identity-mapped by header.S's
#                                  1 GiB 2 MiB-page table, so no extra
#                                  mapping work needed.

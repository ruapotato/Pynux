# arch/x86/kernel/apic.py
#
# Mirrors arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c in Linux at minimal scope: brings
# the boot CPU's Local APIC online and (re)points the timer through it.
# The legacy 8259 PIC is masked off — APIC is the only interrupt
# controller from this point on. SMP bring-up of secondary CPUs is the
# next milestone; this one is the prerequisite (every AP also has its
# own LAPIC and we need ours working first).
#
# LAPIC access is via MMIO at the physical address held in the
# IA32_APIC_BASE MSR (default 0xFEE00000, never moved in practice).
# arch/x86/boot/header.S identity-maps the first 4 GiB with 1 GiB
# pages so the MMIO window is reachable without extra page-table work.
#
# Registers we touch (offsets from LAPIC base):
#
#   0x020  APIC ID                (read-only)
#   0x030  APIC Version
#   0x0B0  End Of Interrupt       (write any value)
#   0x0F0  Spurious Interrupt Vector Register (SVR)
#                                    bit 8  = APIC software-enable
#                                    bits 0..7 = spurious vector
#   0x320  LVT Timer
#                                    bits 0..7 = vector
#                                    bit 17 = periodic mode
#                                    bit 16 = masked
#   0x380  Timer Initial Count
#   0x390  Timer Current Count
#   0x3E0  Timer Divide Configuration  (0x3 = divide-by-16)
#
# Initial count is hand-picked (5_000_000); on QEMU TCG that lands the
# timer somewhere in the few-tens-of-Hz range — plenty to drive
# preemption visibly. Real Linux calibrates LAPIC ticks-per-second
# against PIT/HPET on boot; we'll port that once we want stable HZ.

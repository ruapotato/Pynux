# arch/x86/kernel/time.py
#
# Mirrors arch/x86/kernel/time.c + the PIT bits of
# arch/x86/kernel/i8253.c in Linux. Programs the 8253/8254
# Programmable Interval Timer (chip behind IRQ 0) to fire at ~100 Hz
# and exposes a Pynux-side timer interrupt handler that bumps a
# `jiffies` counter and acknowledges the PIC.
#
# Why PIT and not HPET / TSC-deadline / LAPIC timer? PIT is the
# universally-present option that needs zero ACPI parsing — perfect
# for first boot. Linux walks the same path: setup_default_timer_irq()
# falls back to PIT when nothing more capable is available.
#
# PIT divisor math:
#   PIT base = 1193182 Hz (≈ 1.193 MHz). At target HZ:
#     divisor = base / HZ = 1193182 / 100 = 11931 ≈ 0x2E9B
#   We pick 100 Hz as Linux's classic HZ; cheap, precise enough for
#   wall-clock and scheduler ticks.

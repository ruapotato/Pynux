# Hamnix TODO

Open work items not yet scheduled to a specific milestone. Items here
are fair game for any contributor — human or AI agent.

## Language

- ~~**`do-while` loop** — shipped in commit `c563762`.~~

## Compiler

- Unsigned-comparison codegen extended past `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` — also
  need `shrq` (logical) for unsigned right-shift (today always signed
  `sarq`), and `divq`/`modq` family for unsigned types (today always
  signed `idivq`).
- First-class function pointers — currently every indirect call
  drops into `asm_volatile("call *%rax")`. A real `Fn[R, *A]` type
  with proper SysV codegen would clean up dozens of asm helpers.
- `match`/`case` keyword tokenisation — reserved but not implemented;
  pick one of "Python 3.10 match" or "C switch" and ship.

## Kernel / L-track

- `MAX_EXPORTS=512` ceiling — bump again when we cross ~450 used.
- nf_conntrack core (~155 UND) — blocking conntrack helpers.
- `8021q.ko` (~118 UND, VLAN).
- `libphy.ko` (~153 UND, Ethernet PHY).
- usbcore + xhci_hcd — real-hardware drivers.

## Networking

- ~~Bare-metal virtio-net PCI driver — shipped in M16.88. RX
  delivers real frames to `eth_rx()` via SLIRP-gateway ARP
  round-trip.~~
- IOAPIC programming + real virtio-net IRQ handler — today the
  driver is polled from the kernel init smoke test; without
  IOAPIC routing of PCI INTx we can't take a real interrupt
  yet, so `virtio_net_poll()` is the only RX path.
- ~~Fill in `eth_rx()` body — shipped in M16.90. Header length
  check, ethertype byte-swap, dispatch to `arp_rx`/`ip_rx`,
  drop with diagnostic on unknown type.~~
- ~~ARP responder + cache — shipped in M16.90. RX path learns
  (sender_ip, sender_mac) on both REQUEST and REPLY into an
  8-entry cache; responder builds a reply frame when the target
  protocol address matches our configured IP.~~
- ARP TX via virtio-net — `arp_send_reply()` currently hands the
  frame to `eth_tx()`, which is still a logging stub. Wire a
  real `virtio_net_tx(buf, len)` so peers actually see the
  reply on the wire. Needed before tap-mode validation of the
  responder side.
- IPv4 datagram path beyond the `eth_rx -> ip_rx` stub — header
  + checksum validation, our-address match, dispatch by
  `.protocol` (ICMP/UDP/TCP).
- ICMP echo (ping reply) — first proof of two-way IP traffic.
  Depends on the ARP TX path so peers can resolve us first.
- DHCP client — replaces the hard-coded 10.0.2.15 in the ARP
  probe. Unblocks `apt update` reaching real package mirrors.
- TCP three-way handshake — SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK and a minimal
  receive window. End-state requirement for `apt` over HTTP.

## Userspace / U-track

- Real vDSO blob (mapped page advertised via `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR`),
  replacing the U11-era kernel-side `_lookup_dynsym` hack we
  retired in U20.
- `futex` (202) — real wait/wake table. Today returns -ENOSYS;
  glibc tolerates but multi-threaded musl will need it.
- `clone` / `clone3` (56 / 435) — pthread bring-up.
- Per-task heap state — `linux_brk` is a single global today;
  multi-process Linux binaries will collide.

## Storage

- ~~Native AHCI driver — shipped in M16.89. PCI class probe, ABAR
  map, port scan, polled IDENTIFY + READ DMA EXT of LBA 0 (MBR
  signature check). Unlocks SATA disks on consumer hardware.~~
- AHCI write path (WRITE DMA EXT, 0x35). Symmetrical to the M16.89
  read path; needs port stop/start churn audited under repeat I/O.
- AHCI native command queueing (NCQ) — multiple in-flight commands
  per port via READ FPDMA QUEUED / WRITE FPDMA QUEUED (0x60 / 0x61),
  driven by SACT + per-slot completion. Today every command
  serialises on slot 0.
- AHCI partition-table read (parse MBR + GPT). With M16.89 we
  fetched the MBR bytes but didn't decode them; partition entries
  at MBR offsets 446..510 + GPT header at LBA 1 is the next step
  before mounting a real-hardware ext4.
- AHCI hot-plug / COMRESET / port reset retry — real ThinkPads
  flap SATA on resume; the driver needs to re-init a port that
  drops link.
- ~~NVMe driver — shipped in M16.92. PCI class-match (0x01/0x08/0x02),
  64-bit BAR0 map, controller reset + admin SQ/CQ + CC.EN dance,
  IDENTIFY controller + namespace, CREATE-IO-CQ/SQ, I/O READ of LBA 0
  with MBR signature check. Polled completion via CQ phase bit.~~
- NVMe write path (opcode 0x01) — symmetrical to the M16.92 read path;
  PRP1 = source buffer, CDW10/11 = LBA, CDW12 = NLB-1. Should reuse
  the existing I/O queue + `_io_submit_and_wait` plumbing.
- NVMe multi-queue (one SQ per CPU) — today every I/O serialises on
  qid=1. Per-CPU SQs unlock the scalability the protocol was
  designed for.
- NVMe MSI-X IRQ wiring — replace the busy-poll on CQ phase with an
  actual interrupt handler. Blocks on real IOAPIC + MSI-X bring-up.
- NVMe multi-namespace support — current driver hard-codes NSID=1.
  Real controllers carve multiple namespaces; need IDENTIFY active
  namespace list (CNS=0x02) + a per-NS state struct.

## Toolchain & install

- Real-hardware boot (ThinkPad). FAT32 read + EXT4 r/w done;
  UEFI handover outstanding.
- EFI GOP graphical console. Under UEFI boot, GRUB-EFI doesn't
  program legacy VGA text mode, so `drivers/video/console/vga_text.ad`
  (writes to 0xB8000) is dark on the monitor — UEFI users see only
  the serial console. The multiboot1 framebuffer tag (type 8) is
  available at kernel entry in `%ebx`; parse it for `(base, width,
  height, bpp, pitch)` and add a sibling driver (e.g.
  `drivers/video/console/fb_text.ad`) that renders 8x16 bitmap-font
  glyphs into the linear framebuffer. Hook the new `fb_putc` into
  the same `early_putc` fan-out point. BIOS path is unaffected
  (CGA text framebuffer still works).

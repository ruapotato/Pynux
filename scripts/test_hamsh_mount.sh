# scripts/test_hamsh_mount.sh — HAMSH_SPEC §18 stage 10 acceptance.
#
# Mount handles + union mounts + introspection (§14), end to end
# against a REAL 9P server:
#
#   1. `/bin/p9srv_demo post stage10srv &` — spawn the 9P server in
#      the background. In `post` mode it creates a socketpair,
#      publishes one end on the kernel /srv table as `stage10srv`,
#      and serves 9P over the other.
#   2. `m = mount /srv/stage10srv /n/r as remote` — the `mount … as L`
#      EXPRESSION. mount only ever consumes a srvfd; here it resolves
#      the `/srv/<name>` path through sys_srv_open to a srvfd, runs
#      Tversion+Tattach, records a SRV-kind mount, and stamps the
#      label `remote`. The result is a VT_MOUNT handle bound in `m`.
#   3. `cat /n/r/hello` — reads the real file the 9P server exports
#      ("p9demo says hi\n"), proving the mount carries live 9P traffic.
#   4. `cat /proc/self/ns` — the mount appears, rendered with its
#      label (` as remote`).
#   5. A union sibling — `bind -a /n/r2 /n/r` — stacks at the path;
#      `cat /proc/self/ns` shows the ` -a` union flag.
#   6. `unmount $m` — unmount BY HANDLE. The VT_MOUNT handle
#      interpolates to its label, so the SRV mount is peeled out
#      while the union bind survives. `cat /proc/self/ns` confirms.
#
# Driven prompt-synced via _qemu_drive.sh (waits for the readiness
# marker before the first byte — the 16550 RX FIFO drops input shoved
# in before the shell's read loop is live).

# scripts/test_compiler_unsupported_rejected.sh — guard the "Features
# deliberately not in Adder" section of LANGUAGE.md.
#
# LANGUAGE.md tells agents that certain Python features are not part of
# Adder: exceptions, lambdas, list comprehensions, f-strings, string
# slicing, dict literals, with/context-managers, match/case, sizeof(),
# print()/len()/abs()/etc. The parser accepts them so error messages
# stay readable, but the codegen MUST raise CodeGenError for each.
# This fixture verifies that — if any of these slip into "accidentally
# implemented" the test fails, prompting the implementer to either:
#   (a) actually implement them with a proper compiler test, OR
#   (b) update LANGUAGE.md's "Features deliberately not in Adder" list.
#
# Each case is its own tiny .ad source compiled with `compiler.adder
# asm`. The expected outcome is a non-zero exit + a CodeGenError. If
# any case compiles cleanly, the test FAILS.
#
# This is a HOST-SIDE test: no QEMU boot, just `python3 -m
# compiler.adder asm`. Runs in well under 1 second.

# scripts/test_hamsh.sh - end-to-end test for the M16.35 Hamnix shell.
#
# Boots a kernel whose /init is build/user/hamsh.elf, pipes a short
# sequence of commands (help → hello → exit) into QEMU's serial
# stdio, and greps the captured serial log for evidence that:
#
#   1. the hamsh banner appeared        → main() ran
#   2. the help builtin output appeared → tokenize + builtin dispatch
#   3. the hello child banner appeared → SYS_SPAWN + ELF load worked
#   4. the hamsh "bye" line appeared    → SYS_WAITPID returned and
#                                          the shell's main loop
#                                          continued to the exit
#                                          builtin
#
# Inputs are spaced out with sleeps because the 16550 RX FIFO is only
# 16 bytes and there is no kernel-side software buffer yet (M16.34);
# letting each command drain through SYS_READ before sending the next
# avoids dropped chars. Same trick scripts/test_stdin.sh uses.

# scripts/test_distro_debian.sh - real Debian rootfs running inside a
# Hamnix distro-shape namespace. The follow-on to
# scripts/test_distro_namespace.sh (which proves the namespace bind
# mechanism with a synthetic two-file testdistro fixture); this script
# proves the same mechanism with a REAL debootstrap'd Debian rootfs
# (tests/distros/debian-minbase/rootfs/).
#
# Boot path:
#   1. HAMNIX_EMBED_DEBIAN=1 walks tests/distros/debian-minbase/rootfs/
#      and embeds every file at /var/lib/distros/debian-minbase/<rel>
#      in the cpio archive. (~80-150 MB - default-off because that
#      inflates fs/initramfs_blob.S past GitHub's 100 MB push limit.)
#   2. INIT_ELF=hamsh.elf plants hamsh at /init so the boot drops us
#      at a shell prompt.
#   3. The kernel is rebuilt with the larger initramfs.
#   4. QEMU boots; we drive hamsh through `/bin/distrorun debian-minbase
#      /bin/cat /etc/debian_version` and assert the captured output
#      contains a plausible Debian release token.
#
# Skip-on-missing: if rootfs/bin/true is absent (host hasn't run
# tests/distros/debian-minbase/BUILD.sh), this exits 0 with a SKIP
# message — matching test_u5_linux_binary.sh's pattern, so CI on hosts
# without debootstrap still passes.
#
# Notes on what's actually testable today:
#
#   The Debian-shipped /bin/true + /bin/cat are dynamically linked
#   against glibc (interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2). Hamnix's
#   U-track ELF loader currently handles static-pie binaries; running
#   a dynamically-linked Debian binary needs ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to
#   load as a real ELF interpreter — a separate, larger bring-up.
#
#   So the PRIMARY assertion this script makes is:
#     (a) distrorun successfully entered the namespace
#         ("[distrorun] entered namespace ok")
#     (b) the namespace's /etc/debian_version path resolves to the
#         REAL Debian release string (e.g. "13.5" / "trixie/sid") —
#         proving the bind grafted the debootstrap'd /etc/ into the
#         calling task's view.
#
#   That's the same evidence shape test_distro_namespace.sh gathers
#   for the testdistro fixture, just with a REAL backing tree. When
#   the dynamic-linker work lands, this script can be extended to
#   actually exec /bin/true + assert exit 0.
#
# PASS markers (greppable):
#   [distrorun] entered namespace ok
#   <Debian release token in /etc/debian_version, anywhere in the log>

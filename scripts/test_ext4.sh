# scripts/test_ext4.sh - M16.51..M16.54 verification.
#
# Boots the kernel with build/ext4.img attached via virtio-blk so
# vda is detected as ext4 (FAT magic absent at sector 0). The
# ext4 driver mounts at /ext via the standard probe path. The
# test drives hamsh through `cat /ext/HELLO.TXT` and asserts:
#
#   1. The superblock log lines appeared (M16.51).
#   2. ext4_read_inode produced inode 2 with mode 0x41ED (M16.52).
#   3. The boot-time dirent dump found HELLO.TXT (M16.53).
#   4. cat /ext/HELLO.TXT delivered the marker — meaning the full
#      read path (root lookup → inode → extent → block → VFS →
#      user) works (M16.54).

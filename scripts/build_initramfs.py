scripts/build_initramfs.py — generates a cpio "newc" archive for the
bare-metal Hamnix initramfs and emits it as a .S file of .byte
directives that the kernel image .incbin-includes.

cpio newc layout (per cpio(5)):
  Each entry: 110-byte ASCII header + name + pad-to-4 + data + pad-to-4
  Header fields (each 8 chars of uppercase hex, except magic which is 6):
    magic    "070701"
    ino, mode, uid, gid, nlink, mtime, filesize,
    devmajor, devminor, rdevmajor, rdevminor, namesize, check
  Padding is from the START of the entry; both name and data end
  4-byte aligned.

Final entry: a special "TRAILER!!!" file with size 0 marks end-of-
archive. Linux's init/initramfs.c looks for exactly this string.

Re-run this script after touching the FILES list to regenerate
fs/initramfs_blob.S (which is committed; assembly happens at build
time without re-running this script).

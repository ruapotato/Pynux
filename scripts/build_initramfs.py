scripts/build_initramfs.py — generates a cpio "newc" archive for the
bare-metal Hamnix initramfs and emits it as a .S file of .byte
directives that the kernel image .incbin-includes.

cpio newc layout (per cpio(5)):
  Each entry: 110-byte ASCII header + name + pad-to-4 + data + pad-to-4
  Header fields (each 8 chars of uppercase hex, except magic which is 6):
    magic    "070701"
    ino, mode, uid, gid, nlink, mtime, filesize,
    devmajor, devminor, rdevmajor, rdevminor, namesize, check
  Padding is from the START of the entry; both name and data end
  4-byte aligned.

Final entry: a special "TRAILER!!!" file with size 0 marks end-of-
archive. Linux's init/initramfs.c looks for exactly this string.

Re-run this script after touching the FILES list to regenerate
fs/initramfs_blob.S (which is committed; assembly happens at build
time without re-running this script).

    # U41: CPython stdlib-on-disk embedding hook (DEPRECATED).
    #
    # The default U41 test no longer uses this path. CPython is now
    # built with the bootstrap stdlib frozen INTO the binary's data
    # segment via Tools/scripts/freeze_modules.py (see
    # tests/u-binary/src/cpython/HOWTO.md "Frozen-modules build"),
    # so init_fs_encoding doesn't need /usr/lib/python3.11/ in the
    # initramfs anymore.
    #
    # The hook is kept here (default-OFF) for flexibility: if a
    # future Python distribution scenario wants to ship the on-disk
    # stdlib (e.g. for pip-installed packages, or because a future
    # CPython rebuild trims the frozen set), set HAMNIX_EMBED_PYLIB
    # to the Lib/ path. The walker mirrors every .py file to
    # /usr/lib/python3.11/<relpath> in the cpio archive.
    #
    # CAVEATS (historic):
    #   - The full upstream Lib/ tree is ~1800 .py files. fs/cpio.ad's
    #     NR_FILES cap (192 at the time of the M16.115 attempt) would
    #     need bumping to 4096+ to accept that many entries.
    #   - The generated fs/initramfs_blob.S grows ~6x larger than the
    #     binary archive due to ASCII expansion; with the full stdlib
    #     embedded the blob exceeds GitHub's 100 MiB push cap.

    #     (compiled C extensions — needs a dynamic loader we don't have).

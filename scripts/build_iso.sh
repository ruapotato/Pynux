# scripts/build_iso.sh - Build a hybrid (BIOS + UEFI) bootable ISO for Hamnix.
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. Ensure build/hamnix-kernel.elf exists (rebuild via run_x86_bare's
#      build steps if missing).
#   2. Build the native UEFI PE/COFF stub (build/hamnix-bootx64.efi) from
#      arch/x86/boot/efi_stub.S.
#   3. Stage build/iso/boot/hamnix.elf + grub.cfg.
#   4. Invoke grub-mkrescue to produce build/hamnix.iso (hybrid: legacy
#      BIOS via grub-pc-bin, plus a UEFI ESP image with grub-efi as a
#      fallback). xorriso is the underlying ISO writer.
#   5. Patch the embedded UEFI ESP image: replace its grub-efi-built
#      `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` with our native PE32+ stub so UEFI firmware
#      executes Hamnix's own code with no GRUB middleman.
#
# The resulting ISO is bootable in QEMU (with or without OVMF) and can
# be written to a USB stick with dd (see docs/BOOT.md).
#
# Why two boot paths in one ISO:
#   - BIOS / SeaBIOS: still goes through GRUB (grub-pc-bin) + multiboot1.
#     The grub-mkrescue toolchain is the path of least resistance and the
#     kernel ELF doesn't have a BIOS-callable MBR signature of its own.
#   - UEFI: our native PE/COFF stub is the FIRST piece of Hamnix that
#     runs. No GRUB-EFI dependency, which is the M16.70 priority — UEFI
#     boot on real hardware via ISO image.
#
# Required Debian packages: grub-pc-bin grub-efi-amd64-bin xorriso mtools
#
# Env overrides:
#   HAMNIX_ISO_OUT   output path             (default: build/hamnix.iso)
#   HAMNIX_KERNEL    kernel ELF to embed     (default: build/hamnix-kernel.elf)
#   HAMNIX_EFI_STUB  PE/COFF stub output     (default: build/hamnix-bootx64.efi)

# Stale/partial-intermediate guard. Belt-and-braces for the
# recurring "multiboot1 magic not found" false failure (the primary
# root cause is the SIGPIPE race fixed in the magic check below):
#
#   `ld` writes its output file IN PLACE, incrementally, and is NOT
#   atomic. If a prior build_iso.sh (or any test_*.sh that wraps it)
#   is killed mid-link — agents routinely `timeout` their boot tests,
#   and cron kills runs — `ld` leaves a truncated/partial ELF sitting
#   at the final path build/hamnix-kernel.elf. The multiboot1 magic
#   lives at file offset 0x1000; a file truncated before that point
#   has no magic.
#
# Fix, in two parts:
#   1. Delete any leftover build/hamnix-kernel.elf up front, so the
#      magic check can never see a stale partial file from an aborted
#      prior run.
#   2. Compile to a unique temp path in build/, then `mv` it into the

#      reader either sees the complete file or no file at all, never a
#      half-written prefix. If THIS run is interrupted mid-link, only

# Verify the multiboot1 magic before we bother grub. If the magic is
# missing, grub will silently boot to an unhelpful "you need to load
# the kernel first" prompt.
#
# ROOT CAUSE of the recurring spurious "multiboot1 magic not found"
# false failure (do NOT revert this to the old one-liner):
#
#   The old check was:
#       od ... | tr ... | grep -q '^1badb002$'
#   under `set -o pipefail`. `grep -q` exits the instant it sees the
#   first match — i.e. as soon as the magic word streams past. When
#   `grep` then closes the read end of the pipe, the still-running
#   upstream `tr` (which has ~8 KiB more to write) gets SIGPIPE and
#   dies with exit status 141 (128 + SIGPIPE). With `pipefail`, the
#   pipeline's status becomes that rightmost non-zero 141, the `if !`
#   negates it to "true", and the build aborts — even though the
#   magic was found. It is intermittent purely on scheduling: if `tr`
#   happens to flush its whole output before `grep -q` exits, the run
#   succeeds (PIPESTATUS 0 0 0); otherwise it fails (PIPESTATUS
#   0 141 0). Measured ~2-in-3 spurious failures under load.
#
# FIX: materialise the dump into a variable FIRST (a command
# substitution — no pipe is live while we search), then search the
# string with bash's own pattern match. No process can be SIGPIPE'd,
# so the result depends only on the file contents, never on timing.
# By construction (atomic mv above) this also reads a complete,
# freshly-built ELF, never a stale/partial one.

# ---- Build the native UEFI PE/COFF stub -----------------------------------
#
# The stub is a tiny standalone PE32+ EFI_APPLICATION assembled from
# arch/x86/boot/efi_stub.S. It currently does the EFI handshake (stash
# the EFI handle + system table, print "[hamnix] EFI entry reached",
# call GetMemoryMap + ExitBootServices, print "[hamnix] post-EFI
# handoff complete") and then halts.
#
# Why it still halts instead of `jmp _x86_start_after_loader` (which is
# all the rest of the wiring is structured around): the M16.111+M16.120
# wave assumed the kernel ELF and this stub could be merged into ONE
# hybrid binary so the stub could reach kernel symbols. The detailed
# diagnosis (post-M16.124) is in efi_stub.S's header comment — four
# independent constraints (B1..B4) make "one file is both ELF AND PE+"
# infeasible without restructuring the kernel image format. The cron's
# two real options out (PATH A: UEFI-side ELF loader in this stub;
# PATH B: bzImage-style flat-binary output) are also documented there
# and in docs/BOOT.md's Known-limitations section. Neither was picked
# this round — this commit only updates the documentation to reflect
# the actual blocker so the next agent doesn't reattempt the merge.

#   1. Pre-build the wide ESP FAT image with stub + kernel.
#   2. Run grub-mkrescue normally for the BIOS-bootable side.
#   3. Re-master the ISO with xorriso: drop the small grub-efi

#      UEFI alt-platform record (BIOS path keeps its own El Torito

#      falls through to the GPT ESP partition — which we resize +
#      retarget to point at our wide ESP appended at end of ISO.
#
# Why dropping El Torito UEFI is OK:
#   - The El Torito UEFI alt-platform record points at a 5760-sector
#     /efi.img inside the ISO9660 region — too small for our kernel.
#     We can't enlarge it without corrupting ISO9660 file data.
#   - GPT-based UEFI boot is the modern path: every UEFI machine
#     shipped in the last decade supports it. The El Torito UEFI
#     record was a transitional design from the bzImage / CD-only
#     era.
#   - The BIOS-side El Torito record (platform_id=0x00 i386-pc)

# kernel + headroom for growth. (The kernel grew past the old 8 MB
# budget when it moved to elf64-x86-64 / higher-half.)
# WHY FAT12 (and not FAT16/FAT32):
#   OVMF on Debian rejects El Torito UEFI alt-platform images that
#   carry a FAT16 or FAT32 filesystem — "Not Found" from BdsDxe even
#   when the ESP partition is valid and contains BOOTX64.EFI. Switching
#   the ESP to FAT12 ("mformat" without -F, with explicit -h/-s/-t
#   geometry) makes OVMF load BOOTX64.EFI cleanly.
#   Verified empirically: a 4 MB FAT16 ESP fails with "Not Found"; a
#   4 MB FAT12 ESP with the same contents succeeds and "[hamnix] EFI
#   entry reached" appears on the serial console.
# WHY -c 128 (64 KB clusters, mtools' max): FAT12 has only 4084 usable
#   clusters, so at our chosen size the cluster size must keep us
#   under that ceiling — 128 MB / 64 KB = 2048 clusters, comfortably
#   FAT12. We can't go larger than -c 128 (mformat rejects -c 256 as
#   out-of-range; 128 sectors * 512 B = 64 KiB is the cluster ceiling).
#   Therefore the true ESP ceiling under FAT12 is ~250 MB (4084 * 64 KB).
#   OVMF rejects FAT16/FAT32 so we can't escape that bound — see the
#   rootfs-on-separate-partition note below.
# WHY 128 MB (was 64): the kernel grew to ~86 MB after real Debian
#   apt/dpkg staging landed default-on (HAMNIX_DEFAULT_REAL_DEBIAN
#   defaults to 1 per user direction 2026-05-26). 128 MB ESP holds
#   the current kernel ELF (~86 MB) with ~40 MB headroom.
# ROOTFS-ON-SEPARATE-PARTITION (future): the kernel ELF embedding the
#   whole initramfs hits the FAT12 ~250 MB ceiling fast as we add more
#   distro content. Linux live USBs solve this by laying a tiny EFI
#   partition (kernel only) plus a large rootfs partition (ext4 or
#   squashfs) on the same medium; the kernel mounts the rootfs at boot.
#   When Hamnix wants 1 GB+ of Debian inside the namespace, that's the

# Why not `--efi-boot efi.img -efi-boot-part --efi-boot-image`:

#     would still produce a 2880 KB ESP) or patch the file
#     post-creation. Both lose round-trips.
#   - `-append_partition` + `efi_path=--interval:appended_partition_N:all::`
#     skips that whole dance: the ESP partition source is our
#     pre-built file, declared by file path, no in-tree efi.img
#     needed.
# Drop the wide ESP into the source tree as `efi.img` so xorriso can
# bind both the El Torito UEFI alt-platform record AND a GPT ESP
# partition to it via `--efi-boot efi.img -efi-boot-part`. This is
# the same convention grub-mkrescue uses, just with our oversized
# image. The trailing `--efi-boot-image` makes xorriso also expose

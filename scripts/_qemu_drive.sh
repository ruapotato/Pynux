# scripts/_qemu_drive.sh — prompt-aware QEMU driver for hamsh tests.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The U-track test scripts used to drive hamsh like this:
#
#     ( sleep 3; printf 'cmd\n'; sleep 5; printf 'exit\n' ) | qemu ...
#
# The fixed `sleep 3` assumed hamsh's prompt was ready 3 s after QEMU
# started. As the kernel grew (ext4, USB, the per-process-address-space
# fork, more boot self-tests) boot got slower and less deterministic —
# the input was frequently shoved at the 16550 RX FIFO *before* hamsh
# had even printed its banner, so the first command was simply lost and
# the test MISSed its own pre-fork marker. A fixed sleep cannot be both
# fast and reliable.
#
# qemu_drive() replaces the fixed-sleep subshell with a driver that
# WAITS for a readiness marker to appear on the serial log before it
# sends each command, with a hard timeout backstop. Boot can take 2 s
# or 20 s — the driver adapts.
#
# HIGHER-HALF KERNEL NOTE: the Hamnix kernel is now a true elf64
# higher-half image, and QEMU's built-in `-kernel` multiboot1 loader
# REJECTS 64-bit ELFs. qemu_drive therefore wraps the kernel ELF in a
# minimal BIOS GRUB ISO (via scripts/_kernel_iso.sh) and boots it with
# `-cdrom` — GRUB's multiboot1 loader handles ELFCLASS64 fine. This is
# transparent to callers: they still pass a kernel ELF path.
#
# USAGE
#
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/_qemu_drive.sh"
#   qemu_drive <logfile> <kernel-elf> <ready-marker> <overall-timeout> \
#              -- <cmd1> <after1> <cmd2> <after2> ...
#
#   logfile         where QEMU's serial output is written (caller owns it)
#   kernel-elf      the kernel image (wrapped in a GRUB ISO internally)
#   ready-marker    a literal substring the driver waits for on the log
#                   before sending cmd1 (use hamsh's banner:
#                   "[hamsh] M16.35 shell ready")
#   overall-timeout seconds; the whole QEMU run is bounded by `timeout`
#   cmd / after     a command line to feed to hamsh's stdin, then the
#                   number of seconds to wait before the NEXT command.
#                   The newline is appended automatically.
#
# Extra QEMU args may be supplied via the QEMU_EXTRA_ARGS env var
# (space-separated). Default machine: -smp 2 -m 256M, -nographic,
# -no-reboot, serial to the logfile.
#
# Returns QEMU's exit code in the global QEMU_DRIVE_RC.

# Pull in the higher-half kernel boot shim. _kernel_iso.sh installs a
# build/binshim/qemu-system-x86_64 wrapper and prepends it to PATH, so
# the `qemu-system-x86_64` call below transparently boots the elf64
# kernel from a BIOS GRUB ISO (QEMU's `-kernel` rejects 64-bit ELFs).

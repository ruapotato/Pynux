# scripts/test_hamsh_fdbind.sh — HAMSH_SPEC §18 stage 4 acceptance.
#
# Stdio-as-/fd + pipe/redirect/dup as bind (§7):
#   * `a | b`     resolves to pipe-Chan binds at /fd/1 (producer) and
#                 /fd/0 (consumer) — the pipeline carries data through.
#   * `cmd > f`   binds a file Chan at /fd/1 — output lands in the file.
#   * `cmd 2>&1`  dup-as-bind: /fd/1's Chan is bound also at /fd/2.
#   * CRITICAL (§6): a LOCAL pipe does NO mountrpc. /dev/mountrpc — the
#     cumulative 9P-T-message counter — must read the SAME value before
#     and after a local pipeline. Same shape as the Phase D FD_*_MARK
#     tripwire tests: a local pipe is direct Chan reads, never 9P.
#
# The model: pipe / redirect / dup are ALL the one operation —
# sys_fdbind, "bind a Chan at an /fd/N name". /fd/N is a name in the
# process's Pgrp namespace, served by the `#d` device; the Linux
# integer fd is a Layer-2 mapping onto that name.

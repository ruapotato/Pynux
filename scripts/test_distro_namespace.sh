#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/test_distro_namespace.sh - Phase C.5 regression for
# /bin/distrorun (user/distrorun.ad). Proves the architectural shape
# of distro-shape namespaces works end-to-end on top of Phase C's
# rfork (256) + bind (257) + mount (258) primitives:
#
#   1. distrorun parses argv, opens the per-distro backing directory
#      (/var/lib/distros/<distro>/), rfork(RFNAMEG)s to privatise the
#      namespace, mount()s the backing srvfd at "/" (inert today —
#      Phase D wires the chan dispatch), binds each distro-shape
#      subdir (/etc, /usr, /lib, /var) onto backing/{etc,usr,lib,var},
#      re-binds shared paths (/home, /net, /srv, /dev, /proc), and
#      exec's the target binary.
#
#   2. From inside the namespace, /etc/debian_version reads from the
#      backing's /etc/debian_version ("12.0"), proving the bind
#      grafted the testdistro tree into the calling task's view.
#
#   3. From OUTSIDE the namespace (hamsh's own view, unaffected by
#      the child's rfork), /etc/debian_version still reads Hamnix's
#      native value ("hamnix/0.1") — the namespace mutation is per-
#      task, not global.
#
# Test backing fixture is in tests/distros/testdistro/ (etc/debian_
# version = "12.0", etc/os-release with PRETTY_NAME containing
# "Debian"). build_initramfs.py walks tests/distros/* and embeds each
# file at /var/lib/distros/<name>/<rel>.
#
# PASS markers (grepped below):
#   [distrorun] bound /etc -> backing/etc ok
#   [distrorun] entered namespace ok
#   [testdistro] /etc/debian_version=12.0
#   [native]    /etc/debian_version=hamnix/0.1
#
# Run after Phase C's regressions (test_rfork, test_p9mount) pass.

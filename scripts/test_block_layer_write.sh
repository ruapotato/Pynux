#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/test_block_layer_write.sh — M16.119 verification: AHCI +
# NVMe drivers are now registered with the kernel block layer's
# BlockDeviceOps vtable, so writes submitted via blk_write_sectors()
# reach the real controllers and round-trip through blk_read_sectors()
# byte-for-byte.
#
# We boot QEMU once with BOTH an AHCI disk and an NVMe namespace
# attached. The driver-side smoke tests (M16.118) already validate
# that the driver-level WRITE primitives work; the new tests in
# drivers/ata/ahci.ad::_ahci_blk_smoke_test and
# drivers/nvme/nvme.ad::_nvme_blk_smoke_test verify the SAME bytes
# round-trip through the block-layer vtable (i.e.
# blk_write_sectors(slot, lba, 1, buf) -> blk_read_sectors(slot, lba,
# 1, buf) -> byte equality).
#
# Assertion markers (printed by the kernel after a successful
# round-trip):
#
#   "[ahci] registered as block slot="
#   "[blk] write sd0 LBA=1 OK"
#   "[blk] readback sd0 matches"
#   "[nvme] registered as block slot="
#   "[blk] write nvme0n1 LBA=1 OK"
#   "[blk] readback nvme0n1 matches"
#
# A mismatch banner ("[ahci] blk-smoke: MISMATCH" or
# "[nvme] blk-smoke: MISMATCH") in the log is treated as a hard fail
# regardless of which markers above are present.
#
# Disk images are tmpfile'd per run (dd zero, 1 MiB each, MBR
# signature planted at LBA 0 bytes 510..511 so the existing READ
# smoke tests at LBA 0 keep passing). LBA 1 is the target sector for
# both disks; this is the same LBA the driver-level write smoke tests
# touch, so we're not re-verifying anything the M16.118 tests already
# cover — we're proving the vtable path lands on the right
# controller.
#
# Build lock: source `_build_lock.sh` ONCE here (build_user /
# build_modules / build_initramfs each take the same lock, so don't
# also bash a script that re-takes it).

# scripts/test_high_ram_boot.sh - Boot the Hamnix kernel under QEMU with
#                                 > 4 GiB of RAM and assert both the
#                                 pgtable-extension log line AND that
#                                 hamsh reaches its ready prompt.
#
# This is the regression test for the M16.139-era "real-hardware boot
# bug": booting on hosts with > 4 GiB RAM (Asus laptop ~5 GiB, ThinkPad
# 16 GiB, server N GiB...) the boot stub's 4 GiB identity map was
# insufficient. The first time page_alloc_init() carved a page from a
# memblock region above 4 GiB, the kernel write into that page trapped
# #PF (vector 0x0e err=0x02 — kernel write to not-present), killing
# boot before tss_init / first task ever ran.
#
# arch/x86/mm/pgtable.ad's pgtable_extend_from_e820() — invoked from
# arch/x86/mm/init.ad mem_init() between e820_init() and
# page_alloc_init() — re-walks the multiboot1 mmap and stamps PDPT
# entries for every 1 GiB page that overlaps an E820_RAM region, so
# the allocator sees a fully-mapped identity window for every RAM
# byte the firmware reports.
#
# Two markers are required in order:
#   1. "[pgtable] extended identity map"   - pgtable_extend_from_e820
#                                            ran and logged its summary.
#   2. "[hamsh] M16.35 shell ready"        - kernel got past every later
#                                            allocator-touching step
#                                            (page_alloc smoke, slab,
#                                            APIC, SMP, sched, syscall
#                                            MSRs, first iretq into
#                                            user mode, hamsh exec)
#                                            with RAM above 4 GiB.

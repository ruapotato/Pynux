# scripts/test_u40_musl_busybox.sh -- U40: run the musl-linked
# static busybox on Hamnix.
#
# U29 already proves the glibc-static busybox boots through the
# Linux ABI. U40 proves the musl-static one does too. The point is
# documenting (and exercising) the leaner U-track path: musl's
# static binaries are ~2x smaller than glibc's and reach a
# narrower syscall surface, both useful properties as Hamnix
# scopes toward a real server OS with apt-installable userland.
#
# The fixture (tests/u-binary/u_busybox_musl) is host-built by
# `make -C tests/u-binary/src/musl_busybox install`. If the fixture
# is missing this test SKIPs the same way U22 / U24 / U39 do --
# CI in environments without `musl-tools` keeps moving.
#
# Test flow:
#
#   1. Boot Hamnix with hamsh as /init.
#   2. Stage the musl busybox at /bin/u_busybox_musl AND /bin/busybox
#      (busybox dispatches applets by argv[0] basename; running it
#      under its own multi-call name is what unlocks the banner).
#   3. Drive hamsh to run `busybox` (banner) + `busybox echo ...`
#      (single applet) + `busybox ls /etc` (real syscall surface).
#   4. Grep serial for the expected markers.

# busybox dispatches applets by basename(argv[0]). When invoked
# under an unknown argv[0] (e.g. "u_busybox_musl") it prints

# also stage the same bytes under the multi-call name
# `/bin/busybox_musl`: hamsh's PATH walk finds it, argv[0] is
# then `busybox_musl`, which busybox's dispatcher still doesn't
# recognise as an applet -- but `busybox_musl busybox --help`
# *does* trigger the multi-call banner via busybox's
# `--help` argv-parse fast path. To keep this simple we ship

# test. The existing glibc-busybox staging in build_initramfs.py

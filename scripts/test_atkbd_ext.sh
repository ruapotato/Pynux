# scripts/test_atkbd_ext.sh — M16.100 regression for the polished
# PS/2 keyboard driver: extended scancode decoding, modifier-state
# tracking, Shift/Caps/Ctrl transforms, VT220/xterm escape emission.
#
# Test strategy: drivers/input/atkbd.ad runs a boot-time self-test
# (atkbd_self_test) that feeds 12 synthetic scancode sequences
# through atkbd_process_byte() and asserts the bytes that land in
# the software FIFO. The self-test prints
#   "atkbd: self-test PASS (N cases)"
# on success and
#   "atkbd: self-test FAIL (...)"
# on failure. We assert on the PASS banner over QEMU's serial.
#
# Why this shape and NOT a QEMU `-monitor sendkey` fixture:
# `sendkey` requires the QMP socket or `-monitor stdio` (mutually
# exclusive with `-serial stdio` which we're already using for the
# log), making the test pipeline awkward + flaky. The synthetic-
# scancode self-test exercises the same code paths
# (atkbd_process_byte + the modifier state machine + the extended-
# prefix decoder) deterministically. Manual end-to-end smoke test
# with a real PS/2 keyboard or `-monitor stdio sendkey shift-a`
# remains a follow-up.
#
# Cases covered by the self-test (each documented in the driver):
#   1. lowercase 'a'
#   2. Shift+'a' -> 'A'
#   3. CapsLock latches; break does not toggle; second 'a' still 'A'
#   4. Shift XOR Caps -> 'a' (both pressed cancels)
#   5. Shift+'1' -> '!'
#   6. Ctrl+'c' -> 0x03 (SIGINT byte)
#   7. Ctrl+Shift+'d' -> 0x04
#   8. Arrow Up -> ESC [ A
#   9. Delete -> ESC [ 3 ~
#  10. F1 -> ESC O P
#  11. F5 -> ESC [ 1 5 ~
#  12. extended-form right Ctrl + 'c' -> 0x03, release clears state
#
# PASS criterion: "atkbd: self-test PASS (25 cases)" appears in the
# serial log (25 == total expect_byte calls across the 12 scenarios).

# scripts/test_u_resolve.sh — U-resolve regression: a userland binary
# resolves a HOSTNAME to an IPv4 via the in-kernel DNS resolver and
# connects to it.
#
# Commit 6459613 left `apt update` able to reach a Debian mirror only
# by IPv4 literal (`http://<A.B.C.D>:port/...`). This milestone wires a
# native syscall SYS_RESOLVE (269) that bridges userland to the
# existing in-kernel resolver (drivers/net/dns.ad::dns_lookup), and
# teaches user/apt.ad's URL parser to resolve a hostname through it. An
# IPv4-literal URL keeps working unchanged.
#
# --- DNS SETUP — why this test is shaped the way it is ---------------
#
# The guest's kernel learns its DNS server from DHCP option 6. Under
# QEMU's SLIRP backend that address is ALWAYS SLIRP's own virtual
# nameserver (the `-netdev user,dns=...` value, default 10.0.2.3) and
# SLIRP intercepts UDP/53 to it with a built-in forwarder that proxies
# to the *host's* /etc/resolv.conf resolver. There is no QEMU knob to
# substitute a custom DNS server: a `dns=` outside SLIRP's /24 is
# silently remapped INTO the /24 and still intercepted; a `guestfwd`
# is TCP-only and our resolver is UDP-only. So a hand-rolled host-side
# DNS responder cannot be wired into the guest's resolve path.
#
# Therefore this test drives the resolver through SLIRP's real
# forwarder (same model as scripts/test_dns.sh) and is split in two:
#
#   PHASE 1 — IPv4-literal regression (DETERMINISTIC, always runs).
#     Stands up a host http.server rooted at a fabricated 3-package
#     Debian repo, reachable from the guest at the SLIRP host alias
#     10.0.2.2, and runs `apt update http://10.0.2.2:PORT stable`.
#     Asserts the index is fetched + decompressed + parsed. This is
#     the unchanged-IPv4-path guarantee — it must always PASS.
#
#   PHASE 2 — hostname resolve + connect (REAL DNS; SKIP if offline).
#     Runs `apt update http://deb.debian.org/<nonexistent> stable`.
#     apt's URL parser sees a non-dotted-quad host, calls
#     sys_resolve(269) -> the in-kernel resolver -> a real A-record
#     query through SLIRP's forwarder, then TCP-connects to the
#     returned IPv4 and issues an HTTP GET. Asserts the
#     "apt: resolved deb.debian.org -> <ip>" line printed by the new
#     _resolve_host path AND the "[u_socket] connect -> <ip>:80" that
#     proves the resolved address fed connect(). We deliberately point
#     the path at a NON-EXISTENT repo subtree so the mirror answers a
#     small 404 quickly — that exercises resolve + TCP connect + HTTP
#     round-trip without dragging a multi-MB real Packages.gz through
#     apt's V0 256 KiB buffer. If SLIRP's forwarder gets no answer (CI
#     sandbox blocks egress) the kernel logs "[dns] timeout" and
#     Phase 2 SKIPs — the resolve code path was still compiled + run.
#
# A real FAIL is: Phase 1 regressed, OR Phase 2 resolved a name but
# crashed / never reached connect, OR the kernel reported a CPU trap.
#
# NETWORKING NOTE — the QEMU `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:7-cmd:cat` is
# REQUIRED even though this test never uses that echo target: see the
# identical note in scripts/test_apt_get.sh.

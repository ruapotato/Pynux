# scripts/test_mmap_fork.sh — copy-on-write fork over an mmap VMA.
#
# Boots Hamnix with /bin/u_mmap_fork embedded and drives hamsh to exec
# it. u_mmap_fork is a host-built, static, OSABI=Linux x86_64 ELF that
# exercises the mmap-VMA copy-on-write path (mm/vma.ad::vma_fork_copy
# + the COW-aware free in _vma_node_free):
#
#   For each of 8 iterations: mmap a 2-page anonymous region, write a
#   parent sentinel into both pages, fork(). The child overwrites both
#   pages with a child sentinel and verifies it sees ONLY its own
#   value; the parent wait4()s, verifies its copy still holds the
#   parent sentinel, then munmap()s the region (a COW-shared free that
#   must route through cow_drop_page).
#
# PASS = the serial log shows "MF: start", a "MF: iter ok" per
# iteration, "MF: PASS", and NO "MF: FAIL" line / CPU trap.
#
# Build-on-missing: the fixture is gitignored (host-built). If absent,
# build it from tests/u-binary/src/mmap_fork; only SKIP on a real
# toolchain failure.

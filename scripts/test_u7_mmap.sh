# scripts/test_u7_mmap.sh — U7 milestone: writev + mmap/munmap Linux ELF.
#
# Boots Hamnix with /bin/u_mmap embedded in the initramfs and drives
# hamsh to exec it. u_mmap is a host-built, static, OSABI=Linux x86_64
# ELF whose _start exercises three syscalls that were -ENOSYS stubs
# before U7:
#
#     writev(1, iov[2], 2)             -> two iov entries form the
#                                          line "U7: writev ok\n"
#     mmap(NULL, 0x1000, RW, ANON|PRIV, -1, 0)
#                                       -> non-zero rax = page base,
#                                          a4/a5 must arrive through
#                                          the widened SYSCALL stub
#     munmap(base, 0x1000)             -> rax == 0
#     write(1, "U7: mmap ok\n")        -> success marker
#     exit_group(0)
#
# Skip-on-missing: if tests/u-binary/u_mmap hasn't been built on the
# host (`make -C tests/u-binary/src/mmap install`), exit 0 with a
# notice so CI in environments without `as`/`ld` still passes.

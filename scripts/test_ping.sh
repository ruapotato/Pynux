#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/test_ping.sh — regression test for the native Adder `ping`
# command. Drives the Plan-9-shaped /net/icmp file tree end-to-end:
#
#   user/ping.ad opens /net/icmp/clone, writes `connect 10.0.2.2` to
#   ctl, then loops over writes-of-payload + reads-of-reply on the
#   conn's data file. After each reply it reads /net/icmp/N/status
#   for the seq/ttl/rtt metrics, then prints the standard
#
#     <N> bytes from 10.0.2.2: icmp_seq=<N> ttl=<N> time=<N> ms
#
#   line. SLIRP's emulated gateway 10.0.2.2 answers ICMP echo
#   requests, so the round-trip is fully self-contained — no internet
#   access or host root needed.
#
# The boot rides hamsh-as-init (INIT_ELF=hamsh.elf, same pattern
# scripts/test_linux_apt_install.sh uses) and feeds `/bin/ping -c 3
# 10.0.2.2` over the serial console. ENABLE_PING_SMOKE=1 is also
# plumbed through — scripts/build_initramfs.py picks it up to plant
# /etc/ping-smoke-test in the initramfs, so future kernel-side ping
# smokes (an in-kernel autorun without an interactive prompt) can
# gate on the same marker without changing this test.
#
# REQUIRED MARKERS (full PASS):
#   * "[icmp] tx echo seq=" ... "to 10.0.2.2"        — tx wired
#   * "[icmp] echo reply from 10.0.2.2"              — rx wired
#   * "bytes from 10.0.2.2: icmp_seq="               — userland line
#   * NO "TRAP: vector"                              — no panic
#
# FALLBACK (proof of tx + /net/icmp): if SLIRP refuses ICMP on the
# host's QEMU build (some sandboxed builds drop ICMP echo requests
# because the underlying OS denies raw ICMP) the userland reply
# line never appears. In that case the test PASSes on the tx
# marker alone — the tx path through /net/icmp is the new code
# under test; SLIRP's echo behaviour is the dependency.

# scripts/test_sshd.sh — Hamnix native SSH-2.0 server, end to end.
#
# Builds user/sshd.ad, boots it as /init in QEMU with a SLIRP hostfwd
# that maps a host port onto the guest's port 22, then runs the host's
# REAL OpenSSH client against it and asserts how far it gets.
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. Build userland (incl. sshd + hamsh) -> build/user/*.elf.
#   2. Embed sshd as /init, rebuild the kernel.
#   3. Boot QEMU with hostfwd=tcp::HOSTPORT-:22.
#   4. After the guest prints "[sshd] listening on port 22", run
#         ssh -v -p HOSTPORT root@127.0.0.1 ...
#      with password auth (sshpass if available) and a one-shot command.
#
# Success tiers (the script reports the highest tier reached):
#   TIER 1          : the SSH client's verbose log shows the key
#                     exchange completing — "expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS"
#                     plus the guest log shows
#                     "[sshd] key exchange complete".
#   TIER 2          : authentication succeeds ("[sshd] authentication
#                     succeeded").
#   TIER 2.5        : a session channel opened and hamsh was spawned
#                     and bridged to it.
#   TIER 3 (full)   : the remote command's output comes back over the
#                     SSH channel — a genuinely interactive session.
#
# The script PASSES only at TIER 3: a session that authenticates but
# cannot round-trip a command's output is still broken. TIER 1/2/2.5
# are reported as diagnostic milestones on the way there.

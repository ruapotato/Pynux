# scripts/test_ahci_io.sh — storage L-shim EXERCISE test.
#
# The companion `test_ahci_ko.sh` is a LOAD-only test: it asserts the
# Debian 6.1.0-32 ahci.ko binary's UND surface is closed by
# linux_abi/api_ahci.ad and that init_module / probe runs through the
# cold-path stubs. That's necessary but not sufficient — it doesn't
# prove anything about real block I/O.
#
# This script is the EXERCISE: boot with a real ext4 image attached
# via -device ich9-ahci, set /etc/ahci-ko to (a) skip the hand-rolled
# drivers/ata/ahci.ad smoke-test and (b) kmod_linux_load ahci.ko, then
# run ahci_io_exercise() in init/main.ad which tries to find the
# block device the .ko-shim should have produced (sda / sda1 / sd0 /
# sd0p1) and read /HELLO.TXT off it through fs/ext4.ad.
#
# The PASS / FAIL channel is the [ahci_io_test] marker line emitted
# from ahci_io_exercise(). Whichever happens — PASS or a specific FAIL
# reason — the test script reports it. A FAIL with a specific reason
# is actually the most informative outcome: it pinpoints where exactly
# the storage class L-shim falls short.
#
# Architecture note (M16.x): the .ko's stock libata host_activate ->
# SCSI mid-layer hand-off is fully stubbed out (ata_scsi_queuecmd
# returns -ENODEV, no struct scsi_device gets allocated, no
# register_blockdev is called). To still exercise the path end-to-end
# we BRIDGE the shim's _ahc_ahci_host_activate to the hand-rolled
# AHCI driver's bring-up at exactly the libata "publish ports" point —
# the same point Linux's libata would call ata_host_register() and
# hand off to the SCSI mid-layer. The bridge is in linux_abi/api_ahci.ad
# and is the only place where Hamnix-native code "completes" what the
# Linux .ko's probe started. This is what an L-shim IS: a layer that
# absorbs Linux-driver expectations and translates them to whatever
# the native kernel happens to expose.

# scripts/test_tcp_reconnect.sh — back-to-back active-open regression
# for drivers/net/tcp.ad.
#
# Background: the in-kernel TCP stack used to derive the ephemeral
# SOURCE port from the connection slot index
# (`local_port = TCP_EPHEMERAL_BASE + slot`). _tcp_alloc_slot always
# hands back the lowest free slot, so a run of short-lived
# connections (connect -> small request -> close, repeated) reused
# slot 0 — and therefore the IDENTICAL source port — every time.
# Back-to-back connections to the same server then presented the
# SAME 4-tuple (src ip:port -> dst ip:port); SLIRP (and any strict
# TCP peer) treats a freshly-reused 4-tuple as a duplicate and
# wedges the 3rd/4th rapid handshake — the SYN-ACK never arrives and
# tcp_connect livelocks until its deadline. The apt agent hit this
# installing multiple packages (multiple .deb downloads) and worked
# around it with a wall-clock settle delay between connects.
#
# The fix rotates the ephemeral source port per active-open across
# the IANA dynamic range 49152..65535 (_tcp_ephemeral_next), so two
# back-to-back connections get DIFFERENT 4-tuples and never collide
# — standard TCP behavior, and it sidesteps any TIME_WAIT-style
# just-closed-4-tuple reuse window for free.
#
# This test boots the kernel with a `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:7-cmd:cat`
# netdev (same echo target as test_net_tcp.sh) and the
# /etc/tcp-reconnect-test cpio marker, which gates
# tcp_reconnect_smoke_test() in init/main.ad. That smoke performs 6
# consecutive connect -> "hi\n" -> recv-echo -> close cycles with NO
# delay between them and asserts all 6 succeed.
#
# Required marker (full PASS):
#   "[tcp_reconnect] PASS 6/6 back-to-back connects"
#
# Pre-fix the run would log "[tcp_reconnect] FAIL only N/6 ..." with
# N small (typically 2) — this script does not assert that pre-fix
# artifact; the fix is the artifact.

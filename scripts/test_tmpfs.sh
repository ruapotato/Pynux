# Drives hamsh through:

#     echo hello tmpfs world > /tmp/x
#     cat /tmp/x

# and checks that:
#   - echo's banner is NOT printed to serial (it was redirected)
#   - cat /tmp/x prints "hello tmpfs world" back to serial
#
# That proves: hamsh's `>` parser ran, SYS_SPAWN wired the child's
# fd 1 to a tmpfs entry, echo wrote to it, the entry persisted past
# the child's exit, and cat reopened it for read.

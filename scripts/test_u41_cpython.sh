# scripts/test_u41_cpython.sh -- U41 milestone: full CPython 3.11
# running through the Hamnix U-track Linux ABI.
#
# U39 proved MicroPython (~900 KB) boots through the Linux ABI and
# prints. U41 raises the bar to CPython -- the same binary Debian's
# `apt install python3` actually delivers, with the full stdlib +
# the much wider syscall surface (getrandom, prlimit64, fstatat,
# readlinkat, ...) that real Python apps walk.
#
# Boots Hamnix with /bin/u_cpython embedded in the initramfs and
# drives hamsh to exec it. u_cpython is a host-built fully-static
# OSABI=Linux x86_64 ELF -- CPython 3.11.10 linked `-static`, ~5.7 MB
# stripped. See tests/u-binary/src/cpython/HOWTO.md for the build.
#
# Why this milestone matters: with CPython running, "Hamnix is a
# useful server OS that hosts Python apps" stops being a theoretical
# claim and becomes a demo. M16.104 made brk per-task, which unblocks
# CPython's much more aggressive malloc behaviour (MicroPython had to
# clamp to a 64 KB heap; CPython grows freely now).
#
# The single success marker is the literal "hello from CPython on
# Hamnix" on serial -- that's the line printed by the embedded Python
# expression `print('hello from CPython on Hamnix')`. It can only
# appear if:
#
#   1. hamsh tokenised the quoted -c argument correctly (U17 envp
#      / argv plumbing).
#   2. SYS_SPAWN + ELF loader brought up the static binary
#      (U5 + U10 + U14 paths).
#   3. The interpreter reached its print path through the U4 + U7
#      write/writev syscalls without an unhandled -ENOSYS hit on
#      the boot path.
#   4. CPython's startup didn't trip on a missing syscall that has
#      no glibc fallback (e.g. getrandom -- if -ENOSYS, glibc falls
#      back to /dev/urandom, which we don't have, which would abort).
#
# Skip-on-missing: if tests/u-binary/u_cpython hasn't been built on
# the host (`make -C tests/u-binary/src/cpython install`), exit 0
# with a notice so CI in environments without the host build still
# passes -- same shape as U22/U24/U39/U40. The build takes 15-30 min.
#
# U41 status after the brk/mmap fix + frozen-modules build:
#   - The original blocker (Fatal Python error: pycore_interp_init:
#     failed to initialize importlib / MemoryError) is gone. CPython
#     now runs through pycore_interp_init, _frozen_importlib bootstrap,
#     site.py initialisation, and reaches init_fs_encoding.
#   - The init_fs_encoding "No module named 'encodings'" blocker is
#     also gone. We rebuilt CPython with a widened FROZEN list in
#     Tools/scripts/freeze_modules.py — `encodings.*`, `collections.*`,
#     `enum`, `keyword`, `re`, `functools`, etc. are now compiled into
#     the binary's data segment via `_freeze_module`. The previous
#     HAMNIX_EMBED_PYLIB approach (embed upstream Lib/ tree into the
#     initramfs at /usr/lib/python3.11/) was blocked by fs/cpio.ad's
#     NR_FILES=192 cap + by the assembly blob exceeding GitHub's
#     100 MiB push limit. Frozen-modules sidesteps both. See
#     tests/u-binary/src/cpython/HOWTO.md "Frozen-modules build".
#   - "REGRESSION:" markers below guard against the pycore_interp_init
#     / mmap-alignment regressions returning.

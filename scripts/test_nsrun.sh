#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/test_nsrun.sh — smoke for the nsrun shim launcher
# (user/nsrun.ad).
#
# nsrun runs a program in a FRESH private namespace whose /var, /usr,
# and /etc are each served by a live distrofs 9P daemon. This test
# proves BOTH halves of the Plan 9 invariant with one fixture binary
# (tests/test_nsrun.ad) run several ways from hamsh:
#
#   A. `/bin/nsrun /bin/test_nsrun write`
#      nsrun spawns THREE distrofs daemons (one per subtree), clones
#      the namespace, mounts them at /var, /usr, /etc, then exec's the
#      fixture in "write" mode. The fixture creates + writes + reads
#      back a probe file under EACH of /var/lib/dpkg/, /usr/, /etc/ —
#      paths the initramfs does NOT ship — so a successful round trip
#      proves the ops landed on the distrofs daemons.
#
#   B. `/bin/test_nsrun probe`   (bare — NO nsrun)
#      In the plain shell namespace. /var here is the initramfs view
#      (ships /var/www/* but nothing under /var/lib/dpkg/). The fixture
#      asserts /var/lib/dpkg/nsrun_probe is NOT openable — proving the
#      write from run A did not leak into the parent's namespace.
#
#   C, D. `/bin/nsrun /bin/test_nsrun write` (x2 more)
#      The second and third sequential nsrun invocations. They reuse
#      the same low srvfd numbers run A used; with the p9_conns leak
#      fixed, their mounts MUST still succeed (fresh connection slots).
#
# CONCURRENCY: the /srv post name carries the launcher pid
# (nsrun.distrofs.<pid>.<sub>) so two concurrent nsrun invocations get
# distinct /srv names and never collide. We assert the [nsrun] pid=
# marker is present; a second nsrun run (run C) proves a fresh pid is
# used and its mounts work independently.
#
# CONNECTION-TABLE LEAK FIX: the in-kernel 9P client's p9_conns table
# (sys/src/9/port/9p_client.ad) is now released — on unmount and on
# task exit (chan.ad's mnttab_unmount + pgrp_ref_dec call p9c_detach).
# A 9P connection is owned by the namespace mount entry, refcounted so
# rfork(RFNAMEG) clones share it safely. Because of this, a SECOND and
# THIRD sequential nsrun each get FRESH connection slots even though
# they reuse the same low srvfd numbers. This test runs nsrun THREE
# times sequentially (runs A, C, D) and asserts EVERY run's mounts
# succeed — proving the table no longer leaks.
#
# Pipeline (same shape as scripts/test_9p_realfd.sh):
#   1. Build userland (hamsh + coreutils + distrofs + nsrun).
#   2. Build tests/test_nsrun.ad -> build/user/test_nsrun.elf.
#   3. Plant /init = hamsh.elf.
#   4. Rebuild the kernel image.
#   5. Boot QEMU, drive the invocations over serial, exit.
#   6. Grep the serial log for the markers.
#
# MARKERS asserted (from user/nsrun.ad + tests/test_nsrun.ad):
#   [nsrun] pid=<n>
#   [nsrun] distrofs daemon spawned
#   [nsrun] private namespace cloned
#   [nsrun] distrofs mounted at /var

# scripts/test_hpm_network.sh — end-to-end test for `hpm refresh`
# against the canonical hosted repo `https://255.one/` from a fresh
# QEMU/SLIRP boot. This is the network-side counterpart to test_hpm.sh
# (which exercises hpm against a file:// fixture and proves the CLI
# semantics in isolation from the network stack).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# User report: booting the live ISO in GNOME Boxes (QEMU/SLIRP user-mode
# networking under the hood) and running `hpm refresh` printed
#
#     hpm: cannot resolve 255.one
#     hpm: refresh failed
#
# Root cause: etc/rc.boot unconditionally clobbered the kernel's DHCP-
# bound config with a hard-coded 10.250.10.99 / DNS=10.250.10.1, which
# is not reachable from a SLIRP guest (the SLIRP-emulated DNS lives at
# 10.0.2.3). DNS queries went to the unreachable 10.250.10.1 and never
# came back. Fixed by dropping the unconditional override in rc.boot
# (commit "rc.boot: drop unconditional static-IP override; let DHCP
# win"). This test pins the regression: a fresh boot with SLIRP
# networking must successfully refresh the hosted repo.
#
# WHAT THE TEST DOES
#
#   1. Build the userland + a hamsh-as-init initramfs (so the box
#      lands in the shell after rc.boot finishes, exactly as a real
#      live-ISO boot would).
#   2. Boot QEMU with a virtio-net NIC backed by SLIRP user-mode
#      networking (the SLIRP gateway 10.0.2.2 forwards out to the
#      host's network stack — same path GNOME Boxes uses).
#   3. From the shell, run a quick `ifconfig` + `ping 1.1.1.1` to
#      prove the network is alive, then run `hpm refresh` against
#      the default repo (https://255.one/) and assert the index is
#      fetched + parsed.
#
# REQUIRED MARKERS for PASS:
#   * "[dhcp] got ip=10.0.2.15"          — DHCP succeeded
#   * "  (dhcp)" in ifconfig output      — kernel cfg_src=dhcp (NOT
#                                          overridden by rc.boot)
#   * "hpm: refreshed index from https://255.one/" OR equivalent
#                                        — index fetched + parsed
#   * NO "TRAP: vector"                  — no panic
#
# NETWORK-DEPENDENCY POLICY
#
# This test depends on https://255.one/ being reachable from the host's
# network. If the host has no internet (CI sandbox without egress, or
# the upstream is down) the test PASSes as a SKIP with a NOTE — the
# regression we're guarding is the rc.boot override clobbering DHCP,
# which is provable on its own from the DHCP-state markers. A fully-
# offline CI machine still sees DHCP land at 10.0.2.15 and ifconfig
# report (dhcp); only the final hpm refresh step gets skipped.

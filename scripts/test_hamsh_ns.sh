#
# Ambient namespace + COW-for-externals (§9):
#   * A composition-verb BUILTIN (`bind`) runs in-process and mutates
#     the shell's AMBIENT namespace — it persists, shows up in
#     `cat /proc/self/ns`, and a subsequent command sees it.
#   * An EXTERNAL command gets a copy-on-write PRIVATE copy of the
#     ambient namespace — its `bind` evaporates on exit and NEVER
#     appears in the shell's /proc/self/ns. A command can never
#     corrupt the prompt's view.
#
# The model: the prompt IS the outermost namespace; a bare external
# command runs in a COW clone of it (sys_spawn's SPAWN_STDIO_NS path
# clones the shell's Pgrp); composition verbs are builtins that mutate
# the shell's Pgrp directly.

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/build_user.sh - assemble + link userland binaries.
#
# Builds two kinds of user binary:
#   * a couple of hand-written .S programs (hello, stdin_demo) linked
#     with user/init.lds — elf32-i386 wrappers with 64-bit code inside.
#   * the Adder-compiled userland (init, hamsh, coreutils, daemons).
# The output ELFs are read by scripts/build_initramfs.py and embedded
# into the cpio archive; build/user/init.elf becomes the kernel's
# /init (a thin shim that execs /bin/hamsh with boot rc /etc/rc.boot).
#
# Run this whenever you touch a user/*.S / user/*.ad file or the
# linker script. scripts/build_initramfs.py is what gets called next.

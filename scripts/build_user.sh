# scripts/build_user.sh - assemble + link userland binaries.
#
# For now we have exactly one user binary: user/init.S → build/init.elf
# (elf32-i386 wrapper with 64-bit code inside, just like the kernel's
# own wrapper). The output ELF is read by scripts/build_initramfs.py
# and embedded into the cpio archive as /init.
#
# Run this whenever you touch a user/*.S file or the linker script.
# scripts/build_initramfs.py is what gets called next.

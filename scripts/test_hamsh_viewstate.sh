# scripts/test_hamsh_viewstate.sh — HAMSH_SPEC §18 stage 9 acceptance.
#
# View vs state (§12). The namespace is the *view*; durable state
# lives in the file server behind it. `enter` / `spawn` instantiate a
# fresh, cheap COW copy of the *view* and discard it at the brace —
# but a file written through that view into a server-backed mount
# persists, because it lives in the SERVER, not the view.
#
# THE WIRING
# ----------
#   1. `distrofs post hamsh.dfs &`
#      Background-spawn the distrofs 9P file-server daemon in its new
#      `post` mode: it makes a bidirectional socketpair, publishes one
#      end on /srv/hamsh.dfs, and serves 9P over the other. The daemon
#      IS the persistent backing — its RAM tables live as long as the
#      daemon process, independent of any namespace view. (Across a
#      reboot the ext4 snapshot layer carries it — that is separately
#      proven by scripts/test_distrofs_persist.sh.)
#   2. `s = ns { mount /srv/hamsh.dfs /dfs }`
#      Capture a namespace TEMPLATE: a view that mounts the distrofs
#      daemon at /dfs. The template is configured, not entered.
#   3. `enter s { touch /dfs/x ; bind /tmp /dfs/transient }`
#      First entry: a fresh COW view applies the template, writes a
#      file THROUGH the view into the distrofs daemon's backing, and
#      also adds a TRANSIENT bind that belongs only to this view.
#   4. `enter s { cat /dfs/x ; cat /proc/self/ns }`
#      Second entry: a *different* fresh COW view re-applies the same
#      template. /dfs/x is THERE — the state persisted in the daemon.
#      The transient bind from entry #1 is GONE — the view was
#      discarded at the brace.
#
# ACCEPTANCE: /dfs/x visible on the re-enter (state durable), the
# transient bind absent (view ephemeral). That is §12 / §18.9.

# scripts/test_u37_busybox_pipe3.sh -- U37: busybox sh + PATH-walked
# child exec via `echo a | grep a`.
#
# U36 left this pipeline as "informational" because busybox sh's
# userspace PATH walk couldn't find grep — Hamnix only had
# /bin/u_busybox and /bin/busybox, not /bin/grep / /bin/sh. U37 stages
# multiple cpio entries pointing at the busybox payload (option 2 from
# the spec) so busybox's argv[0]-dispatch sees a binary at every
# applet path it walks.
#
# Required PASS criteria (U37 surface):
#   * BEFORE_PIPE3 + AFTER_PIPE3 sentinels both reach the serial log
#     (proves hamsh keeps running across the pipeline attempt).
#   * busybox sh's PATH-walked exec no longer fails with -ENOENT on
#     /sbin/grep (the U36 trace's most prominent miss). The cpio
#     resolves a busybox-bytes entry at every PATH dir it probes.
#
# Best-effort criterion:
#   * Literal "a" line from grep filtering echo's output. The current
#     gap is downstream of U37: busybox-as-grep runs out of its 4 KiB
#     user stack inside glibc's static-PIE startup after the
#     PATH-walked execve. Tracked as a U38 candidate (grow execve's
#     ustack page allocation in arch/x86/kernel/syscall.ad).

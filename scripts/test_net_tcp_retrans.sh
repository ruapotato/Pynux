# scripts/test_net_tcp_retrans.sh — exercise M16.108 TCP retransmission.
#
# M16.108 added per-segment retransmission to the TCP client per
# RFC 6298 (SRTT + RTTVAR + RTO + exponential backoff, max 5 retries).
# Proving the RTO path fires from a kernel-only test is hard:
#
#   * `-netdev user,id=n0,restrict=on` silently drops outbound TCP
#     but ALSO suppresses the synthesised ARP reply that SLIRP
#     normally hands back for in-subnet hosts, so the smoke test's
#     ARP for 10.0.2.100 never resolves and tcp_connect bails
#     before the SYN goes out.
#
#   * `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:7-tcp:<unroutable>:N` doesn't help
#     either — SLIRP opens the host connection at QEMU startup and
#     refuses to start the VM if the destination is unreachable.
#
#   * Any working `guestfwd=...-cmd:foo` makes SLIRP synthesise the
#     SYN-ACK on the guest side immediately, so the handshake
#     completes before the first RTO can possibly fire.
#
# Because QEMU's user-mode networking is loss-free by construction,
# we verify the RTO logic in three layers and require all three:
#
#   1. Static evidence: grep the linked kernel ELF for the two
#      printk format strings that only _tcp_check_retrans emits.
#      If the compiler didn't keep them, the code path is dead.
#
#   2. Live evidence: run the test_net_tcp.sh-shaped boot with a
#      pretend-blackhole netdev (guestfwd to a tarpit chardev that
#      ACCEPTS the host-side TCP but never reads — SLIRP still
#      synthesises the guest-side SYN-ACK so retrans doesn't fire
#      there, but if `restrict=on` ever does drop SYNs in a future
#      libslirp release we'll see the `[tcp] retrans #1 rto=` line
#      land naturally). Either marker is acceptable evidence the
#      RTO timer ticked at least once during the run.
#
#   3. Regression: the existing happy-path echo test
#      (test_net_tcp.sh shape) must still PASS so we know we
#      haven't broken the live wire.
#
# PASS conditions (BOTH must hold):
#   * strings(kernel ELF) shows both
#       "[tcp] retrans #" AND "[tcp] connect timeout after"
#   * one of:
#       (a) live boot logs `[tcp] retrans #1 rto=` + `[tcp] connect
#           timeout after`  -> full RTO exercised
#       (b) live boot completes the happy-path handshake-and-echo
#           (no SLIRP-side packet loss to trigger RTO) -> regression
#           proves the code didn't break the loss-free path

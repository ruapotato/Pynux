# scripts/test_usb_hid_v2.sh — V2 regression for the xHCI interrupt-IN
# continuous-poll path.
#
# V0 (scripts/test_usb_hid.sh) shipped controller-detect + HID translator
# self-test. V1 (scripts/test_usb_hid_v1.sh) shipped the transfer engine
# (Enable Slot + Address Device + Configure Endpoint + control xfers)
# and a single-event Event-Ring round-trip. V2 closes the gap: the
# interrupt-IN endpoint is armed with 4 read TRBs, the timer-tick poll
# loop drains the Event Ring continuously, and each harvested report
# re-arms a fresh Normal TRB so the controller keeps streaming.
#
# What this test asserts:
#
#   1. The V2 continuous-poll self-test passes — three synthetic
#      interrupt-IN completions ('h', 'i', '!') get harvested by
#      xhci_poll back-to-back, each one re-arming the interrupt-IN
#      Transfer Ring. PASS marker:
#
#         [usb_hid_v2] PASS
#
#      A FAIL surfaces as `[usb_hid_v2] FAIL` plus per-event diag.
#
#   2. The V1 transfer-engine self-test still passes (we don't regress
#      the single-event path).
#
#   3. The V0 HID translator + atkbd PS/2 self-tests still pass.
#
#   4. No kernel panic / unexpected trap between init phases.
#
# Wire-side keystroke test (qemu sendkey x):
#
#   This script *attempts* a true wire-side keystroke harvest via the
#   QEMU monitor's `sendkey` command, but treats it as ADVISORY. The
#   real-hardware exchange depends on qemu-xhci's exact SETUP encoding
#   acceptance which varies across QEMU versions; the synthetic-event
#   PASS is the load-bearing marker. The wire-side attempt:
#
#     a. Boots QEMU with -monitor unix:./mon.sock,server,nowait.
#     b. After the V2 self-test PASS banner lands on serial, sends
#        `sendkey x` via the monitor socket using socat (or nc -U).
#     c. Greps the boot log for either a hamsh echo of 'x' or for
#        xhci.reports_received climbing above the baseline of 3
#        (the V2 self-test count).
#
#   If the wire-side attempt succeeds we log "[usb_hid_v2] WIRE: OK".
#   If it doesn't, we log "[usb_hid_v2] WIRE: NOT OBSERVED" — that's
#   not a hard FAIL because the synthetic-event PASS already proved the
#   poll/dispatch wiring is sound.
#
# Pass marker:    [usb_hid_v2] PASS
# Fail marker:    [usb_hid_v2] FAIL

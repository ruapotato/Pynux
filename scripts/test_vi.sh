# scripts/test_vi.sh — the native modal editor user/vi.ad, end-to-end.
#
# vi is a full-screen modal editor that OWNS the raw console: when hamsh
# spawns it, fd 0/1/2 are bound to DEVFD_CONS (no kernel line-cooking,
# no echo), and vi reads one keystroke at a time with sys_read_nb +
# sys_yield (exactly the input model hamsh's own line editor uses). This
# test boots hamsh directly as /init so that raw-console path is active,
# drives vi over the serial console with scripted keystrokes, then reads
# the file back with `cat` to prove the edits were saved.
#
# COVERAGE
#   1. INSERT-mode typing + Enter-splits-line + Esc + `:wq` round-trips
#      a brand-new file to tmpfs ("hello world" / "second line").
#   2. Re-opening the saved file and applying NORMAL-mode edits — `x`
#      (delete char), `dd` (delete line) — then `:wq` mutates the file
#      as expected.
#   3. `:q!` force-quits a buffer with unsaved changes WITHOUT writing.
#
# Escape bytes via printf octal: ESC = \033.

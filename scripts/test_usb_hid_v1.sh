# scripts/test_usb_hid_v1.sh — V1 regression for the xHCI transfer engine.
#
# V0 (scripts/test_usb_hid.sh) proved the controller-detect + root-hub
# port-scan + HID-report-to-ASCII self-test. V1 adds the wire: Command
# Ring + Event Ring + slot lifecycle + control transfers + interrupt-IN
# polling. This script asserts the V1-specific markers:
#
#   1. The V1 transfer engine bring-up reached "controller running"
#      (RS=1, HCH=0). Without this Command Ring submission can't
#      complete and nothing else happens.
#
#   2. The synthetic transfer-engine self-test fired: we hand-write
#      one Transfer Event TRB into the Event Ring, call xhci_poll, and
#      assert that hid_kbd_report received it. The PASS marker is:
#
#         [xhci_v1] transfer-engine PASS (N reports)
#
#      This proves the *plumbing* (event-ring dequeue, cycle bit
#      tracking, hid_kbd_report dispatch, kbd_rx_push handoff) works
#      end-to-end without depending on whether qemu-xhci's live SETUP
#      handler accepted our TRB encoding on a given QEMU version.
#
#   3. The V0 markers still all PASS — the V0 self-test still emits
#      "[usb_hid] self-test PASS (17 cases)" and the atkbd PS/2 path
#      still emits "atkbd: self-test PASS (25 cases)". Any V1 patch
#      that accidentally drained the FIFO or broke the PS/2 driver
#      surfaces as a missing banner here.
#
# What this script DOES NOT do today: it does NOT use QEMU's `sendkey`
# QMP command to simulate a real keystroke. That path requires the
# live SETUP/Address Device/SET_PROTOCOL exchange to complete against
# qemu-xhci's emulated HID device, which is heavily TRB-encoding
# sensitive and varies across QEMU versions. The synthetic-completion
# test is a deliberate compromise from the V1 plan: it proves the
# transfer-engine code paths work even when the live exchange is
# flaky. See drivers/usb/xhci.ad's `xhci_v1_selftest()` docstring for
# the design rationale.
#
# Pass marker:    [usb_hid_v1] PASS
# Fail marker:    [usb_hid_v1] FAIL

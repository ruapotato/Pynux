# scripts/test_nvme_io.sh — storage L-shim EXERCISE test for NVMe.
#
# The companion `test_nvme_ko.sh` is a LOAD-only test: it asserts
# the Debian 6.1.0-32 nvme.ko binary's UND surface is closed by
# linux_abi/api_nvme.ad and that init_module / probe runs through
# the cold-path stubs. The hand-rolled drivers/nvme/nvme.ad
# claims the controller first; nvme0n1 in that test's output is
# real because the HAND-ROLLED driver registered it. The .ko shim
# is just probing against an already-enabled controller.
#
# This script is the EXERCISE: gate the hand-rolled NVMe driver
# OFF via /etc/nvme-io-ko, then dep-load nvme-core.ko + nvme.ko via
# modules_dep_load_with_deps("nvme") so the cross-module ksymtab
# replaces api_nvme.ad's cold-path stubs with nvme-core's REAL
# EXPORT_SYMBOL impls, and finally run nvme_io_exercise() in
# init/main.ad which tries to find a block device that the .ko-shim
# path produced and read /hello.txt off it through fs/ext4.ad.
#
# Critical difference from test_ahci_io.sh: NO BRIDGE. The AHCI
# exercise routes _ahc_ahci_host_activate back to the hand-rolled
# drivers/ata/ahci.ad bring-up so the L-shim "completes" what the
# Linux .ko's probe started. The NVMe exercise does NOT do that.
# If nvme.ko + nvme-core.ko can't carry namespace scan + add_disk
# end-to-end on the L-shim, that's a finding, not a thing to paper
# over.
#
# Strict assertions (added with the nvme-core side-load milestone):
#   * Hand-rolled SKIPPED marker fires.
#   * boot:35.N modules_dep_load_with_deps marker fires.
#   * BOTH nvme-core.ko AND nvme.ko load (loader emits name=X for
#     each in its .modinfo pass).
#   * Cross-module ksymtab dispatches: [ksymtab_hit] nvme ->
#     nvme_core: nvme_submit_sync_cmd MUST fire — that's the
#     entire reason for the side-load.
#   * [bridge=disabled] fires (no hand-rolled fallback).
#
# PASS path: nvme_io_exercise mounts ext4 from a real block device
# the .ko-shim path registered, reads + writes + verifies /hello.txt.
#
# FAIL path (current state, fully informative): nvme.ko's nvme_probe
# schedules nvme_reset_work via async_schedule_node — our shim
# DROPS the work because we have no async-kthread worker, so the
# controller is never CC.EN'd, no IDENTIFY runs, no namespace scan,
# no add_disk. The exercise emits "no NVMe block device registered"
# and exits FAIL. The fix is to wire MSI-X IRQ delivery (or a
# polled-completion path) and uncomment the sync-dispatch block in
# api_nvme.ad's _nvm_async_schedule_node.
#
# The PASS / FAIL channel is the [nvme_io_test] marker line
# emitted from nvme_io_exercise(). [bridge=disabled] is always
# expected; its absence is itself a regression.

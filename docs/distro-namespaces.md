In Hamnix, as in Plan 9, there is no global root. The kernel knows
about file servers — disk filesystem drivers, kernel device drivers,
9P servers. A namespace is a per-process binding of paths to those
servers. Init's namespace is constructed at boot from a kernel-default
set of mounts (hamnixfs at /, devcons at /dev/cons, etc.); every
subsequent process inherits its parent's namespace and can modify its
own copy with `bind` / `mount` / `unmount` / `rfork(RFNAMEG)`.

A **distro-shape namespace** is a namespace assembled to look like a
particular Linux distribution. From inside it, paths resolve to a
Debian / Ubuntu / SUSE / etc. backing store: `/bin/bash`,
`/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`, `/etc/passwd` in Debian's format.
It is **not different in kind** from init's namespace — both are just
namespaces. The convention that init mounts hamnixfs at `/` is a
choice the boot scripts make, not a privileged property of the kernel.
A user could legitimately boot Hamnix and immediately replace init's
`/` mount with a remote 9P export — that's a valid configuration,
not an escape from anything.

Imported Linux binaries (apt, dpkg, postgresql, python3) run inside
distro-shape namespaces because that's the namespace shape they
expect. Native Adder binaries (hamsh, ls, the coreutils) run inside
init's default namespace because that's the namespace shape *they*
expect. Neither is the "real" /; they're peer namespaces.

## Layout

Two example namespaces a user-facing process might inhabit. The
"Default init namespace" column is the namespace `/etc/rc` builds at
boot; the "Debian-shape namespace" column is what `distrorun debian-trixie`
constructs.

| Path | Default init namespace | Debian-shape namespace |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| /bin | hamnixfs — Adder binaries (hamsh, ls, ps, cat, ...) | distro backing — Debian binaries (bash, ls, apt, dpkg, ...) |
| /lib | hamnixfs — minimal Adder runtime support | distro backing — `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, glibc, ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 |
| /usr | hamnixfs — minimal | distro backing — full Debian /usr (share, lib, bin, ...) |
| /etc | hamnixfs — Hamnix config (motd, passwd, group, rc, os-release) | distro backing — Debian config (debian_version, apt/, dpkg/, ld.so.cache, ...) |
| /var | hamnixfs — minimal | distro backing — Debian /var (lib/dpkg, log, cache/apt, ...) |
| /home/$user | shared bind (same file server in both) | shared bind (same file server in both) |
| /net | ipd 9P server (same in both) | ipd 9P server (same in both) |
| /srv | srvfs 9P server (same in both) | srvfs 9P server (same in both) |
| /dev | kernel cdev family (same in both) | kernel cdev family (same in both) |
| /proc | kernel proc family — pids are global per Plan 9 (same in both) | kernel proc family (same in both) |

Note that `/bin`, `/lib`, `/usr`, `/etc`, `/var` resolve to different
file servers in each namespace; `/home`, `/net`, `/srv`, `/dev`,
`/proc` resolve to the same servers in both (via shared `bind`).

## Boundary rules

1. **No file server is privileged.** hamnixfs is a file server.
   /var/lib/distros/debian-trixie/ (mounted via a disk filesystem
   driver on whatever block device holds it) is a file server. A
   process binding either at `/` is doing the same kind of thing.
   The kernel doesn't distinguish "the real root" from "a chroot."
2. **Distro-shape namespaces have no init.** A namespace is a
   workspace for running individual binaries (or an interactive
   bash shell), not a parallel system. Hamnix's service management
   stays in init's namespace (hamsh + /etc/rc), which can launch a
   Linux service *into* a distro-shape namespace when needed.
3. **`apt` and `dpkg` mount their package state in their own
   namespace.** They write to /var/lib/dpkg, /etc/apt, /usr/lib/* —
   all of which, in their namespace, resolve to the distro backing
   store. Init's namespace is untouched not because it's protected
   but because nothing in the apt namespace binds anything to it.
4. **Multiple distro-shape namespaces coexist trivially.**
   /var/lib/distros/debian-bookworm/, debian-trixie/, ubuntu-noble/,
   suse-tumbleweed/ each back a different namespace shape; processes
   pick which one to inherit at namespace-construction time.
5. **Cross-namespace IPC is via shared file servers.** /srv (9P) and
   /net (ipd's sockets) are bound by convention in every namespace
   from the same servers. A Debian-shape postgres talks to a native
   Adder service through /srv/postgres or /net/tcp the same way two
   native services would.
6. **Distro-shape namespaces are NOT a security boundary.** They
   change which file servers serve which paths, not what a process
   is allowed to do. A process inside a Debian-shape namespace is
   exactly as privileged as it would be in init's namespace. For
   privilege isolation, layer additional namespace restrictions on
   top (e.g., `bind -c` on /dev to drop access to specific cdevs).

## Backing stores

Two implementations, in order of expected build:

1. **Disk-backed (debootstrap path).** /var/lib/distros/debian-trixie/
   is a real Debian rootfs extracted via `debootstrap` (run once on a
   host Linux box, copied onto a Hamnix-mounted disk). The disk
   filesystem driver — ext4, fat — is the file server. Entered with
   `mount` at the namespace's `/` after `rfork(RFNAMEG)`. Heavy but
   works immediately.
2. **`debfs` 9P server (deferred).** A Layer 3 service that
   synthesizes Debian's FHS layout on demand from a package store
   (.deb archives or pre-extracted contents in object-storage form).
   Lighter, composable, more Plan 9. Build after Phase F when Layer 3
   services are routine.

## Entry point

A userland binary at `/bin/distrorun`, with convenience aliases at
`/bin/deb`, `/bin/ubuntu`, `/bin/suse` for common distros:

```
distrorun <distro-name> <command> [args...]
# convenience aliases:
deb bash                       # → distrorun debian-trixie bash
deb apt install postgresql
ubuntu apt install nginx
```

Reference implementation (pseudocode):

```
distrorun(distro, argv):
    backing = "/var/lib/distros/" + distro
    if not exists(backing):
        error("unknown distro: " + distro)
    rfork(RFNAMEG)                          # private namespace copy
    mount(backing, "/", MREPL, "")          # rebind / to the distro server
    bind("/home", "/home", MREPL)           # keep the shared servers
    bind("/net",  "/net",  MREPL)
    bind("/srv",  "/srv",  MREPL)
    bind("/dev",  "/dev",  MREPL)
    bind("/proc", "/proc", MREPL)
    exec(argv[0], argv)
```

The five `bind` calls are what re-expose the shared file servers
inside the new namespace. Without them, `/dev/cons` (the console),
`/net/tcp` (sockets), and `/home/david` (the user's files) would
all resolve to whatever the distro backing happens to ship for
those paths — typically nothing useful.

## Phase placement

Depends on Phase C (rfork RFNAMEG + bind + mount syscalls). Lands as
**Phase C.5: distro-shape namespaces** — after Phase C's primitives
work, before Phase D's hamwd, since hamwd isn't on the critical path
for server workloads.

## Why this shape

- **There's no "Hamnix vs. Debian" rivalry at the kernel level.**
  hamnixfs is one file server. A Debian rootfs on disk is another.
  Both are equally "real" to the kernel. The OS isn't a Hamnix-Debian
  hybrid; it's a kernel that lets each process pick a namespace shape.
- **`apt install` is naturally scoped.** Package managers do their
  filesystem mutations on whatever file server backs their namespace's
  /. That happens to be the distro backing store. Removing a distro
  is `rm -rf /var/lib/distros/<name>/` from a namespace that has the
  disk file server bound there.
- **Multiple distros coexist trivially.** Same Hamnix image can host
  Debian-bookworm and Ubuntu-noble concurrently; their `/usr` trees
  never overlap because they're served by different file servers.
- **No new kernel mechanism required.** This is a *convention* on top
  of what Phase C already lands. No new syscalls, no new kernel
  subsystem — just an entry-point binary and a directory naming
  convention.

## What this does NOT include

- **No distro-shape namespace for native Adder binaries.** They run
  in init's namespace because that's the one they're built against.
  Running them inside a Debian-shape namespace would just hide them
  behind FHS noise.
- **No automatic path translation between namespaces.** A
  Debian-namespace process referring to /home/david sees the same
  file-server response as a native-namespace process referring to
  /home/david, because both /home mounts bind the same server. There
  is no symbolic-path translation across namespaces — bytes match
  because the same server answers both reads.
- **No nested distro-shape namespaces.** A process inside Debian-shape
  cannot launch a SUSE-shape sub-namespace from within. Could be added
  if a use case appears; deferred until then.
- **No PID isolation.** Plan 9 / Hamnix pids are global. /proc shows
  all processes regardless of namespace. PID isolation, if ever
  wanted, lives at a different layer.
- **No security boundary.** See Boundary rule 6.

## Comparison to Linux schroot

Linux's schroot is the closest existing analog *in shape*: both
arrange for a binary to see a different `/`. They differ in **what
"different" means**.

- **schroot** creates a chroot — restricting a process to a subtree
  of "the real /". There IS a real /, the kernel knows it, and the
  chrooted process is restricted to a view of it. Escape is a
  meaningful concept (CVE-able).
- **Hamnix distrorun** binds the namespace's / to a different file
  server. There is no "the real /" at the kernel level. The new
  namespace isn't restricted; it just has different file servers
  serving different paths. There's nothing to escape from.

The distinction matters: if you internalise schroot's framing,
distrorun looks like a weaker container. If you internalise Plan 9's
framing, distrorun looks like a configuration choice. The latter is
what Hamnix actually does.

## Test discipline

Phase C.5 lands green when all of the following pass:

1. `bash scripts/test_l_track.sh` — existing .ko regression suite.
2. `bash scripts/test_u_track.sh` — existing ELF-userland regression
   suite.
3. `bash scripts/test_distro_namespace.sh` (new):
   - `deb /bin/true` exits 0
   - `deb /bin/bash -c 'echo hi'` prints "hi"
   - `deb cat /etc/debian_version` reads from the distro backing
     store (a process in init's namespace and a process in the
     debian-shape namespace observe different file-server responses
     at the path /etc/debian_version)
   - `cat /etc/os-release` from init's namespace still shows
     Hamnix's os-release — because nothing in init's namespace has
     rebound /etc to anything else
   - `deb stat /home/$USER` and `stat /home/$USER` show the same
     inode — both /home binds resolve to the same file server
   - Two concurrent `deb bash` sessions don't see each other's
     namespace bindings — each got its own copy via rfork RFNAMEG
